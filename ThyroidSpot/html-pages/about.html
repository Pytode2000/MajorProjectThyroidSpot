                    Antibody & Product Development (APD) Lab Group is a Singaporean lab doing research for Singapore and Singaporeans in mind
                    set up in Oct 2013 with support from Sir David Lane and from BSF (now called Research Support Services).
                    Our multi disciplinary work spans across molecular cell biology, computer science, biomolecular modelling,
                    psychology, IoT, scientific phone apps, augmented reality, and psychology. We are unique in possibly
                    being the only lab in the world with reasonable achievements in the various disciplines simultaneously,
                    all within the short six years or so (see facebook.com/APDLab and twitter.com/DrSamuelGan), We demonstrate
                    our own capabilities through our own efforts in ethical scientific publishing and research practices,
                    providing scientific services and even attracted overseas drug developers for validation! Our work in
                    antibody engineering and drug design is summarised in our perspective article (Phua et al., 2018) and
                    our post-doc Dr Su was also recognized for her work sufficiently to be invited for journal submissions
                    (Su et al., 2019). See https://www.facebook.com/APDLab/videos/336377246957654/ for our work on drug design
                    using HIV as a model. We have to date > S$5M of grants, of which ~ S$4M comes directly to us.</p>

                <h3 style="display: block; text-align: center">Achievements</h3>

                <p class="para">Since 2013, we produced >70 publications from our own research, where APD folks are first
                    and/or corresponding authors. We trained -80 interns from local institutions, graduated ~ 40 degree project
                    students in Biomed Eng, Psych, Biomed, and developed ~50 products (including apps, Google Play Store
                    – APD Lab or Apple App Store – Samuel Gan). We were highlighted in media world-wide hundreds of times,
                    including by Frost & Sullivan, Bloomberg, Yahoo Finance, etc. We are also home to the first and only
                    specialized “Scientific Phone Apps and Mobile Devices” journal in the area, as well as the neutral multi-level,
                    multi-disciplinary open-access student journal “APD Trove”. On average, we have a paper and intern trained
                    per month! No one can say truthfully that we leeched off anyone for our publications or training.</p>

                <h3 style="display: block; text-align: center">Grooming Local Talents</h3>

                <p class="para">As a lab funded via the government agency, what better way to invest Singapore taxpayer money
                    than on grooming young Singaporeans? We groomed local talent from scratch (nobody can truthfully say
                    we poached any one) with a lab team of all locals with the exception of our post-doc trained in NTU,
                    and our software engineer from Temasek Polytechnic serving her tuition grant bond to Singapore. Every
                    one of our staff had contributed significantly to the lab’s notable research output and many who joined
                    us in 2013/4continue to be productive scientists in their own right with us. Even our interns walked
                    away with a publication/product from their short stint, outperforming many PhD holders (just refer to
                    our annual publication list). Notable examples include Mr Joshua Yeo with 8 publications; Mr Phua Ser
                    Xian with 4 first-author publications; Mr Ron Chiang with a first-author paper; Mr Sim JZ who made >7
                    mobile apps with publications. The list goes on to >70 interns! We even have publications that the PI
                    willingly let the students publish on their own for their own credit. Clearly, with our allocated research
                    budget, we punched above our weight significantly. We even attracted an Asst Prof to express interest
                    in joining APD Lab as a visiting scientist!</p>

                <p class="para">Working with RSC A*STAR, we supported no less than five local companies, and are working
                    towards formal support to the local community via Enterprise Singapore and SERC. We are the only lab
                    in BII to do so, and are in the midst of preparing potential spinoffs from our work.
