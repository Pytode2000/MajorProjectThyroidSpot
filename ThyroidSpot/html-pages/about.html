                <h3 style="display: block; text-align: center">WHAT WE DO</h3>

                <p>Our research creates economic growth and jobs for Singapore. As a Science and Technology Organisation,
                    we bridge the gap between academia and industry in terms of research and development. In these endeavours,
                    we seek to integrate the relevant capabilities of our research institutes and collaborate with the wider
                    research community as well as other public sector agencies towards meaningful and impactful outcomes.
                    Together with the other public sector entities, we develop industry sectors by: integrating our capabilities
                    to create impact with Multi-National Corporations and Globally Competitive Companies; partnering Local
                    Enterprises for productivity and gearing them for growth; and nurturing R&D-driven Start-ups by seeding
                    for surprises and shaping for success. Our research, in addition, also contributes to societal benefits
                    such as improving outcomes in healthcare, urban living, and sustainability. These serve to enhance lives
                    in Singapore and beyond.</p>
